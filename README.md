#     Probabilistic Algorithm Based on Cellular Automata for Parallel Tumor Growth Simulations

Code of CUDA implementation of the Probabilistic Algorithm based on Cellular automata for parallel tumor growth simulations based on the poleszcuk and Enderlings proposal.

There is also a PDF of the complete formulas of the probabilistic calculation.

The command make run, will execute the parallel program using a 1024x1024 CUDA grid.
